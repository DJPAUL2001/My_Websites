      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <div>
        <p style="padding: 0px 80px 0 80px;">
           I'm Dhruba Jyoti Paul. And I have taken the initiative to keep you informed about Nuke Proliferation that is taking place globally.       
      I am a Bangladeshi who lives in Dhaka. I am a 9th grader of AISD (American International School Dhaka). 
      I am quite short(my height is unknown to me), I weigh 47kg, I have black hair and a brown skin complexion. 
      I am quite timid but once I feel comfortable I intend to express my lurid humor(my brother's word), however this is rarely the case as I almost always feel confined in my life.
      My favourite sport is cricket which I follow daily. My favourite national football team is Argentina and favourite club is Barcelona.

      <h2>Why Nuke Proliferation</h2>
    <div>
          <p>
With Nuclear Weapons, our world will be gone with a blink of an eye. 
These 'things' that can basically lead to the extinction of the human race are multiplying in numbers, 
            <br>yet the ordinary public doesn't have a clue. 
The people have the right to know. If they are not aware of the catastrophe we are approaching towards, <br>then the catastrophe can never be prevented.
