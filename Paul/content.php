      <u><h2>The Nuclear Cancer</h2></u>
    <p>
      We all know what a cancer is. For the basics, it is when a body cell goes out of control and starts dividing rapidly.
      <br>In the first few phases, when the cancer is in just one part of the body, operation can cure the patient.
      <br>But if the matter is not taken care off, soon, the cancer cell cuts itself from the other normal cells and spreads throughout the entire body.
      <br>And that is the time when it's too late and cancer is uncurable and death is certain.
    </p>
      
      <p>
        Nuke Proliferation, which I had refered to as 'The Nuke Cancer' is somewhat similar. The Nukes are multiplying in our Earth even today.
        <br>It progressing towards obliteration just like a simple cancer. But what's worse is that, the detonation of one single bomb could lead to a 'dominoe effect' of the detonation of all the other ones.
        <br>In other words, it takes thousands and thousands of cancer cell to kill a single human, but it'll just take one nuke to create a catastrophe that could lead to the death of billions.

<!--DOOMSDAY CLOCK-->
<h2>The Doomsday Clock</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock">The Doomsday Clock is a symbol which represents the likelihood of a global catastrophe.</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="">2017: For the last two years, the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock stayed set at three minutes before the hour, the closest it had been to midnight since the early 1980s. 
  In its two most recent annual announcements on the Clock, the Science and Security Board warned: “The probability of global catastrophe is very high, and the actions needed to reduce the risks of disaster must be taken very soon.”
  In 2017, we find the danger to be even greater, the need for action more urgent. It is two and a half minutes to midnight, the Clock is ticking, global danger looms. 
  Wise public officials should act immediately, guiding humanity away from the brink. 
  If they do not, wise citizens must step forward and lead the way.  See the full statement from the Science and Security Board on the 2017 time of the Doomsday Clock.</blockquote>

<h2>A Glance at the Current Situation</h2>
<p>
  On March 13th, 2017, a survey was carried out to have an idea of how the people view Nuke Proliferation. 
  <br>The First Graph Surprisingly shows that 25% of the people don't think Nuke Proliferation is a global issue.</br>

</p>


<p>
  This shows when people thought the world was closest to its end. The Majority is correct!

</p>

<p>
  This shows how much familiar the people are with the Doomsday clock. Even on this one, the Majority is aware.

<h3>Types of Opinions people generally have</h3>

<p>
 Even with the graphs sharing and conveying similar ideas, the people still have conflicting ideas of what should be done with the Nuclear Powers at hand.
